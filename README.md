# UNA VDC Servers
Development of our UNA VDC Servers. 

### What are UNA VDC Servers?

Let's brake it down.

- UNA = UNA is an CMS (Community Management System)
- VDC = Our VDC servers stand for Virtual Dedicated Cloud. The power of an dedicated server at half the price.

Our UNA VDC Server Packages are designed specially to cope with UNA and the possible requirements of the script and it's traffic.

### What is this Repo for?

This Repo is for the development of our UNA VDC Packages, and due to the fact we manage every aspect of the package from server management to UNA script management. This also includes apps. 

Not just that we plan on integrating our Billing > Server Management > UNA Management > UNA App Management as a work-flow allowing simple management of our Packages.

So this Repo is for the development of our Packages and their integration with UNA.
